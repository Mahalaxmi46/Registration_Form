# Registration_Form
Registration Form using HTML, Tailwind CSS, JS
Implemented a dynamic registration form using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to register with the system. The registration form collects user information including name, email, password, date of birth (DOB), and acceptance of terms. Key features of the project include:

User Input Validation: Implemented client-side validation to ensure all required fields are filled out and the user agrees to the terms before submission. Additionally, added validation to ensure that the date of birth falls within a specific range (between 18 and 55 years old).

Persistent Data Storage: Utilized localStorage to persist user registration data across sessions. This allows registered users' data to be saved locally and retrieved even after the page is refreshed or reopened.

Dynamic Table Population: Upon registration form submission, the user's information is added dynamically to a table displayed on the webpage. This table includes columns for Name, Email, Password, DOB, and whether the user accepted the terms.
